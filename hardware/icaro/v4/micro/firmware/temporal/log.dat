WARNING: The target device seems to support XINST and no #pragma config XINST=OFF was found.
         The code generated by SDCC does probably not work when XINST is enabled (possibly by default).
         Please make sure to disable XINST.
         (If the target does not actually support XINST, please report this as a bug in SDCC.)
